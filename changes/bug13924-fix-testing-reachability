  o Minor bugfixes (Testing networks)
    - Stop assuming that private addresses are local when checking
      reachability in a TestingTorNetwork. Instead, when testing, assume
      all OR connections are remote. (This is necessary due to many test
      scenarios running all nodes on localhost.)
      This assists in bootstrapping a testing Tor network.
      Fixes bug 13924; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc. Patch by "teor".
