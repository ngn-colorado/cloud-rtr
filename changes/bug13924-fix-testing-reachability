  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Stop assuming that private addresses are local when checking
      reachability in a TestingTorNetwork. Instead, when testing, assume
      all OR connections are remote. (This is necessary due to many test
      scenarios running all nodes on localhost.)
      This assists in bootstrapping a testing Tor network.
      Fixes bugs 13718 & 13924.
