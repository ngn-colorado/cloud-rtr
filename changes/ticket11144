  o New features (sample torrc):
    - Add a new, infrequently-changed "torrc.minimal".  This file's
      purpose is similar to torrc.sample, but it is meant to be small
      and change as infrequently as possible, for the benefit of
      users whose systems prompt them for intervention whenever a
      default configuration file is changed. Making this change
      allows us to update torrc.sample to be a more generally useful
      "sample torrc".
