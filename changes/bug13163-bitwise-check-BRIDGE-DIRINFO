  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Bitwise check the BRIDGE_DIRINFO flag rather than using equality.
      Fixes a (potential) bug where directories offering BRIDGE_DIRINFO and
      some other flag (i.e. microdescriptors or extrainfo) would be ignored
      when looking for bridge directories. Partially fixes bug 13163.
