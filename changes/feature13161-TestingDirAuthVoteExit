  o Minor features (testing):
    - Add the TestingDirAuthVoteExit option, a list of nodes to vote
      Exit for regardless of their uptime, bandwidth, or exit policy.
      TestingTorNetwork must be set for this option to have any effect.
      Works around an issue where authorities would take up to 35 minutes
      to give nodes the Exit flag in a test network, despite short
      consensus intervals. Partially implements ticket 13161.
