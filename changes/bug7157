 o Minor features:
   - Alter the Path Bias log messages to be more descriptive in terms
     of reporting timeouts and other statistics.
   - Create three levels of Path Bias log messages, as opposed to just
     two. These are configurable via consensus as well as via torrc
     options PathBiasNoticeRate, PathBiasWarnRate, PathBiasExtremeRate.
     The default values are 0.70, 0.50, and 0.30 respectively.
   - Separate the log message levels from the decision to drop guards,
     which also is available via torrc option PathBiasDropGuards.
     PathBiasDropGuards defaults to 0 (off).
   - Deprecate PathBiasDisableRate in favor of PathBiasDropGuards
     in combination with PathBiasExtremeRate.
   - Increase the default values for PathBiasScaleThreshold and
     PathBiasCircThreshold from 200 and 20 to 300 and 150, respectively.
   - Add in circuit usage accounting to path bias. If we try to use a
     built circuit but fail for any reason, it counts as path bias.
     Certain classes of circuits where the adversary gets to pick your
     destination node are exempt from this accounting. Usage accounting
     can be specifically disabled via consensus parameter or torrc.
   - Convert all internal path bias state to double-precision floating
     point, to avoid roundoff error and other issues.
   - Only record path bias information for circuits that have completed
     *two* hops. Assuming end-to-end tagging is the attack vector, this
     makes us more resilient to ambient circuit failure without any 
     detection capability loss.
