  o Minor features:
    - New option "HiddenServiceAllowUnknownPorts" to allow hidden
      services to disable the anti-scanning feature introduced in
      0.2.6.2-alpha. With this option not set, a connection to an
      unlisted port closes the circuit.  With this option set, only a
      RELAY_DONE cell is sent.  Closes ticket #14084.
