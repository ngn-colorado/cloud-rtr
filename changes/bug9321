  o Major features:
    - Introduce the Guardfraction feature which improves the load
      balancing of path selection towards guard nodes. Specifically,
      it aims to reduce the traffic gap that guard nodes experience
      when they first get the Guard flag. This is a required step if
      we want to increase the guard lifetime to 9 months or greater.
