  o Minor bugfixes:
    - If ExcludeNodes is set, consider non-excluded hidden service
      directory servers before excluded ones. Do not consider excluded
      hidden service directory servers at all if StrictNodes is
      set. (Previously, we would sometimes decide to connect to those
      servers, and then realize before we initiated a connection that
      we had excluded them.) Fixes bug 10722; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
