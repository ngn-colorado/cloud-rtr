  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Consider non-excluded hidden service directory servers before
      excluded ones. Do not consider excluded hidden service directory
      servers at all if StrictNodes was set.  (Previously, we would
      sometimes decide to connect to those servers, and then realize
      before we initiated a connection that we had excluded them.)
      Fix for bug #10722. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha. Reported by
      "mr-4".
