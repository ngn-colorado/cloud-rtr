  o Major features (changed defaults):
    - Prevent relay operators from unintentionally running exits: When
      a relay is configured as an exit node, we now warn the user
      unless the 'ExitRelay' option is set to 1. We warn even more
      loudly if the relay is configured with the default exit policy,
      since this tends to indicate accidental misconfiguration.
      Setting 'ExitRelay' to 0 stops Tor from running as an exit relay.
      Closes ticket 10067.

  o Removed features:
    - To avoid confusion with the 'ExitRelay' option, 'ExitNode' is no
      longer silently accepted as an alias for 'ExitNodes'.
