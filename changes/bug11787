  o Minor bugfixes (directory bandwidth performance):
    - Don't flush the zlib buffer aggressively when compressing
      directory information for clients.  This should save about 7% of
      the bandwidth currently used for compressed descriptors and
      microdescriptors. Fixes bug 11787; bugfix on 0.1.1.23.
