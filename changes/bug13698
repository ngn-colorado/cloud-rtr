  o Major bugfixes:
    - When closing an introduction circuit that was opened in
      parallel, don't mark the introduction point as
      unreachable. Previously, the first successful connection to an
      introduction point would make the other uintroduction points get
      marked as having timed out. Fixes bug 13698; bugfix on 0.0.6rc2.
