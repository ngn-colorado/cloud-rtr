  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Silence clang warnings under --enable-expensive-hardening, including:
        + implicit truncation of 64 bit values to 32 bit;
        + const char assignment to self;
        + tautological compare; and
        + additional parentheses around equality tests. (gcc uses these to
          silence assignment, so clang warns when they're present in an
          equality test. But we need to use extra parentheses in macros to
          isolate them from other code).
      Fixes bug 13577.
