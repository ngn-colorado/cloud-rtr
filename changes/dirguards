  o Major features:
    - Preliminary support for directory guards: when possible,
      clients now use guards for non-anonymous directory requests.
      This can help prevent client enumeration.  Note that this
      behavior only works when we have a usable consensus directory:
      and when options about what to download are more or less
      standard.  Implements proposal 207; closes ticket 6526.
