  o Minor bugfixes (hidden services):
    - When fetching hidden service descriptors, check not only for
      whether we got the hidden service we had in mind, but also
      whether we got the particular descriptors we wanted. This
      prevents a class of inefficient but annoying DoS attacks by
      hidden service directories. Fixes bug 13214; bugfix on
      0.2.1.6-alpha. Reported by "special".
