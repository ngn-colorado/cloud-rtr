  o Major bugfixes (mixed relay-client operation):

    - When running as a relay and a client at the same time (not
      recommended), if we decide not to use a new guard because we
      want to retry older guards, only close the locally-originating
      circuits passing through that guard. Previously we would close
      all the circuits. Fixes bug 9819; bugfix on
      0.2.1.1-alpha. Reported by "skruffy".
