m  o Major features (hidden services):
    - Add a HiddenServiceStatistics option that allows Tor relays to
      gather and publish statistics about hidden service usage, to
      better understand the size and volume of the hidden service
      network. Specifically, if a Tor relay is an HSDir it will
      publish the approximate number of hidden services that have
      published descriptors to it the past 24 hours. Also, if a relay
      has acted as a hidden service rendezvous point, it will publish
      the approximate amount of rendezvous cells it has relayed the
      past 24 hours. The statistics themselves are obfuscated so that
      the exact values cannot be derived. For more details see
      proposal 238 "Better hidden service stats from Tor relays". This
      feature is currently disabled by default. Implements feature 13192.
