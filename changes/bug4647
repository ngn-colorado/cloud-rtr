  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Use a single command-line parser for parsing torrc options on the
      command line and for finding special command-line options to avoid
      inconsistent behavior for torrc option arguments that have the same
      names as command-line options. Fixes bugs 4647; bugfix on 0.0.9pre5.
