  o Major bugfixes (client, automap):
    - Repair automapping with IPv6 addresses; this automapping should
      have worked previously, but one piece of debugging code that we
      inserted to detect a regression actually caused the regression
      to manifest itself again. Fixes bug 13811; bugfix on
      0.2.4.7-alpha. Diagnosed and fixed by Francisco Blas Izquierdo Riera.
