 o Major features (security, hidden services):
   - Make HS port scanning more difficult by sending back REASON_DONE if the
     exit policy didn't match. Furthermore, immediately close the circuit to
     avoid other connection attempts on it from the possible attacker trying
     multiple ports on that same circuits. Closes ticket 13667.
