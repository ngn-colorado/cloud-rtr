  o Minor features:
    - Use a script to replace "A1" ("Anonymous Proxy") entries in our
      geoip file with real country codes.  This script fixes about 90% of
      "A1" entries automatically and uses manual country code assignments
      to fix the remaining 10%.  See src/config/README.geoip for details.
      Fixes #6266.
