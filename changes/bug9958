  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Report bootstrapping progress correctly when we're downloading
      microdescriptors. We had updated our "do we have enough microdescs
      to begin building circuits?" logic most recently in 0.2.4.10-alpha
      (see bug 5956), but we left the bootstrap status event logic at
      "how far through getting 1/4 of them are we?" Fixes bug 9958;
      bugfix on 0.2.2.36, which is where they diverged (see bug 5343).
