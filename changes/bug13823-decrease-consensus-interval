  o Minor bugfixes (Testing networks):
    - Decrease minimum consensus interval to 10 seconds
      when TestingTorNetwork is set, or 5 seconds for
      the first consensus.
      Fix assumptions throughout the code that assume larger interval values.
      This assists in quickly bootstrapping a testing
      Tor network.
      Fixes bugs 13718 and 13823; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.
