  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Decrease minimum consensus interval to 10 seconds
      when TestingTorNetwork is set. (Or 5 seconds for
      the first consensus.)
      Fix code that assumes larger interval values.
      This assists in quickly bootstrapping a testing
      Tor network.
      Fixes bugs 13718 & 13823.
