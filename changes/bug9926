  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Remove some old fallback code designed to keep Tor clients working
      in a network with only two working relays. Elsewhere in the code we
      have long since stopped supporting such networks, so there wasn't
      much point in keeping it around. Addresses ticket 9926.
