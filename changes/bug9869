  o Minor features (build):

    - Assume that a user using configure --host wants to cross-
      compile and error if we cannot find a properly named tool-
      chain. Add --disable-tool-name-check to enable the user
      to build nevertheless. Addresses ticket 9869. Patch by
      Benedikt Gollatz.
