  o Minor bugfixes (linux seccomp sandbox):
    - Refactor the getaddrinfo workaround that the seccomp sandbox
      uses to avoid calling getaddrinfo() after installing the sandbox
      filters. Previously, it preloaded a cache with the IPv4 address
      for our hostname, and nothing else. Now, it loads the cache with
      every address that it used to initialize the Tor process. Fixes
      bug 11970; bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.
