  o Minor features:
    - When the Linux syscall sandbox finds an illegal system call, it
      now tries to log a stack trace before exiting. Resolves ticket
      11465.

  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Using the Linux syscall sandbox no longer prevents stack-trace
      logging on crashes or errors. Fixes part 11465; bugfix on
      0.2.5.1-alpha.
