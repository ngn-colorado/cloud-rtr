  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Avoid excluding guards from path building in minimal test networks,
      when we're in a test network, and excluding guards would exclude
      all nodes. This typically occurs in incredibly small tor networks,
      and those using TestingAuthVoteGuard *
      This fix only applies to minimal, testing tor networks,
      so it's no less secure.
      Discovered as part of #13718.
