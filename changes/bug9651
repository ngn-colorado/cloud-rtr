  o Minor features:
    - When ServerTransportPlugin is set on a bridge, Tor can write more
      useful statistics about bridge use in its extrainfo descriptors,
      but only if the Extended ORPort ("ExtORPort") is set too. Add a
      log message to inform the user in this case. Resolves ticket 9651.
