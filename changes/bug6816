  o Infrastructure features:
    - Introduce new circuitmux_t storing the queue of circuits for a channel;
      this encapsulates and abstracts the queue logic and circuit selection
      policy, and allows the latter to be overridden easily by switching out
      a policy object.  The existing EWMA behavior is now implemented as a
      circuitmux_policy_t.  This fixes bug 6816.
