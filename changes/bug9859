  o Major features:
    - The bridge directory authority now assigns status flags (Stable,
      Guard, etc) to bridges based on thresholds calculated over all
      Running bridges. Now bridgedb can finally make use of its features
      to e.g. include at least one Stable bridge in its answers. Fixes
      bug 9859.
  o Minor features:
    - Add threshold cutoffs to the networkstatus document created by
      the Bridge Authority. Fixes bug 1117.
