  o Minor features:
    - Try harder to diagnose a possible cause of bug 7164, which causes
      intermittent "microdesc_free() called but md was still referenced"
      warnings. We now log more information about the likely error case,
      to try to figure out why we might be cleaning a microdescriptor
      as old if it's still referenced by a live node.
