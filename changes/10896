  o Minor features:
    - Support OpenBSD's divert-to rules with the pf firewall, when
      "TransProxyType pf-divert" is specified. This allows Tor to run a
      TransPort transparent proxy port on OpenBSD 4.4 or later without
      root privileges. See the pf.conf(5) manual page for information on
      configuring pf to use divert-to rules. Closes ticket 10896; patch
      from Dana Koch.
