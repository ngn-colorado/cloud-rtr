  o Minor features:

    - AutomapHostsOnResolve now support IPv6 addresses. By default, we
      prefer to hand out virtual IPv6 addresses, since there are more of
      them and we can't run out. To override this behavior and make
      IPv4 addresses preferred, set NoPreferIPv6Automap on whatever
      SOCKSPort or DNSPort you're using for resolving. Implements
      ticket #7571.

    - AutomapHostsOnResolve responses are now randomized, to avoid
      annoying situations where Tor is restarted and applications
      connect to the wrong addresses.
