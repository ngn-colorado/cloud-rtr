  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Improve the warning message when trying to enable the Linux
      sandbox code on a Tor built without libseccomp. Instead of
      saying "Sandbox is not implemented on this platform", we now
      explain that we to need be built with libseccomp. Fixes bug
      11543; bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.
