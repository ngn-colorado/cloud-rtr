  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Build using the -fasynchronous-unwind-tables option so that more
      platforms (in particular, ones like 32-bit Intel where the
      -fomit-frame-pointer option is on by default and table
      generation is not) will support generating backtraces. This
      doesn't yet add Windows support yet; only Linux, OSX, and some BSD
      are affected. Reported by 'cypherpunks'; fixes bug 11047; bugfix
      on 0.2.5.2-alpha.
