  o Major features (downloading):
    - Upon receiving a server descriptor, microdescriptor, extrainfo
      document, or other object that is unparseable, if its digest
      matches what we expected, then mark it as not to be downloaded
      again. Previously, when we got a descriptor we didn't like, we
      would keep trying to download it over and over. Closes ticket
      11243.
