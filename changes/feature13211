  o Major features (performance):
    - Allow clients to use optimistic data when connecting to a hidden
      service, which should cut out the initial round-trip for client-side
      programs including Tor Browser. (Now that Tor 0.2.2.x is obsolete,
      all hidden services should support server-side optimistic
      data.) See proposal 181 for details. Implements ticket 13211.
