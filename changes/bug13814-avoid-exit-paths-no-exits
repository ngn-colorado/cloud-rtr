  o Minor features (Testing networks):
    - Avoid building exit circuits from a consensus with no exits.
      Now thanks to our fix for 13718,
      we accept a no-exit network as not wholly lost, but
      we need to remember not to try to build exit circuits on it.
      Closes ticket 13814;
      patch by "teor".
