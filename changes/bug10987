  o Minor bugfixes

    - Fix IPv6 support when using the SocksPort with SOCKS5. Using IPv6
      through a SOCKS5 using the SocksPort option will now work with
      this fix. This part of the code has never been updated to support
      IPv6 thus this does not fix a previously introduced regression.
      Fixes bug 10987; bugfix on 0.2.4.7-alpha.
