  o Bugfixes:
    - Add configure options controlling allocator tricks like mempools and
      freelists, and turn them off by default; on most platforms malloc is
      reasonable enough for this not to be necessary, and a similar feature
      in OpenSSL exacerbated Heartbleed.  Fixes bug #11476.
