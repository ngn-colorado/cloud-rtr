  o Minor bugfixes:
    - When receing a DNS query for an unsupported type, reply with
      no answer rather than with a NOTIMPL error. This behavior isn't
      correct either, but it will break fewer client programs, we hope.
      Fixes bug 10268; bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha. Original patch
      from "epoch".
