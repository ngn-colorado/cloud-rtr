 o Minor bugfixes:
   - Fix mal-merge of channels that ORed END_CIRC_REASON_CHANNEL_CLOSED into
     reason codes in circuit_truncated().
   - Fix unknown reason warning in circuit_end_reason_to_control_string()
     to use LD_PROTOCOL rather than LD_BUG when the bad reason originated
     elsewhere.
