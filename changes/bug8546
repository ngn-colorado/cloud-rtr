  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Move fields related to isolating and configuring client ports
      into a shared structure. Previously, they were duplicated across
      port_cfg_t, listener_connection_t, and edge_connection_t.
      Failure to copy one of them correctly had been the cause of at
      least one bug in the past.
