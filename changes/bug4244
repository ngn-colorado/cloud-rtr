  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Stop modifying the value of our DirReqStatistics torrc option just
      because we're not a bridge or relay. This bug was causing Tor
      Browser users to write "DirReqStatistics 0" in their torrc files
      as if they had chosen to change the config. Fixes bug 4244; bugfix
      on 0.2.3.1-alpha.
