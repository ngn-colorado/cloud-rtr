  o Major features:
    - On some platforms (currently: recent OSX versions, glibc-based
      platforms that support the ELF format, and a few other
      Unix-like operating systems), Tor can now dump stack traces
      when a crash occurs or an assertion fails. By default, traces
      are dumped to stderr (if possible) and to any logs that are
      reporting errors. Implements ticket 9299.
