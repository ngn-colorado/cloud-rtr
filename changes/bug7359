  o Major features (controller):
    - Extend ORCONN controller event to include an "ID" parameter,
      and add four new controller event types CONN_BW, CIRC_BW,
      CELL_STATS, and TB_EMPTY that show connection and circuit usage.
      The new events are emitted in private Tor networks only, with the
      goal of being able to better track performance and load during
      full-network simulations. Implements proposal 218. Resolves
      ticket 7359.
