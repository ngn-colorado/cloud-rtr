  o Minor features (relay):
    - Instead of limiting the number of queued onionskins to a configured,
      hard-to-configure number, we limit the size of the queue based on how
      many we expect to be able to process in a given amount of time. We
      estimate the time it will take to process an onionskin based on average
      processing time of previous onionskins.  Closes ticket 7291. You'll
      never have to configure MaxOnionsPending again.
