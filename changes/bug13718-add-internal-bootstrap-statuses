  o Minor bugfixes (Testing networks):
    - Add "internal" to some bootstrap statuses when no exits are available.
      If the consensus does not contain Exits, Tor will only build internal
      circuits. In this case, relevant statuses will contain the word
      "internal" as indicated in the Tor control-spec.txt. When bootstrap
      completes, Tor will be ready to handle an application requesting an
      internal circuit to hidden services at ".onion" addresses.
      If a future consensus contains Exits, exit circuits may become available.
      Fixes part of bug 13718; bugfix on 0.2.4.10-alpha. Patch by "teor".
