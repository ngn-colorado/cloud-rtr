  o Major bugfixes:
    - When a circuit accidentally has the same circuit ID for its
      forward and reverse direction, correctly detect the direction of
      cells using that circuit. Previously, this would have made
      roughly one circuit in a million non-functional. Fixes bug
      12195; this is a bugfix on every version of Tor.
