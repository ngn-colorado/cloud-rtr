  o Minor features (testing):

    - When bootstrapping a test network, few relays get the Guard
      flag. There is now a new option, TestingDirAuthVoteGuard, which
      can be used to specify a set of relays which should be voted
      Guard regardless of uptime or bandwidth. Addresses ticket 9206.
