  o Minor features:
    - On Windows, spawn background processes using the CREATE_NO_WINDOW
      flag. Now Tor Browser Bundle 3.5 with pluggable transports enabled
      doesn't pop up a blank console window. (In Tor Browser Bundle 2.x,
      Vidalia set this option for us.) Implements ticket 10297.
