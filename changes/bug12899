  o Removed features:
    - The "AuthDirRejectUnlisted" option no longer has any effect, as
      the fingerprints file (approved-routers) has been deprecated.
    - Directory authorities do not support being Naming dirauths
      anymore. The "NamingAuthoritativeDir" config option has been
      obsoleted.
