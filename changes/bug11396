  o Minor features (security):

    - If you don't specify MaxMemInQueues yourself, Tor now tries to
      pick a good value based on your total system memory. Previously,
      the default was always 8 GB. You can still override the default by
      setting MaxMemInQueues yourself. Resolves ticket 11396.

  o Minor features (controller):
    - Because of the fix for ticket 11396, the real limit for memory
      usage may no longer match the configured MaxMemInQueues value.
      The real limit is now exposed via GETINFO limits/max-mem-in-queues.
