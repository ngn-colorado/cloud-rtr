  o Minor features (security):

    - If you don't specify MaxMemInQueues yourself, Tor now tries to
      pick a good value based on your total system memory. Previously,
      the default was always 8 GB. You can still override the default by
      setting MaxMemInQueues yourself. Resolves ticket 11396.
