 o Minor features:
   - Improve circuit build timeout handling for hidden services.
     In particular: adjust build timeouts more accurately depending
     upon the number of hop-RTTs that a particular circuit type
     undergoes. Additionally, launch intro circuits in parallel
     if they timeout, and take the first one to reply as valid.
