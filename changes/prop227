  o Minor features (directory system):
    - Authorities can now vote on the correct digests and latest versions for
      different software packages. This allows packages that include Tor to use
      the Tor authority system as a way to get notified of updates and their
      correct digests. Implements proposal 227. Closes ticket 10395.
