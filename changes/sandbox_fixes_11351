  o Major features:
    - Refinements and improvements to the Linux seccomp2 sandbox code:
      the sandbox can now run a test network for multiple hours without
      crashing. (Previous crash reasons included: reseeding the OpenSSL PRNG,
      seeding the Libevent PRNG, using the wrong combination of CLOEXEC and
      NONBLOCK at the same place and time, having server keys, being an
      authority, receiving a HUP, or using IPv6.) The sandbox is still
      experimental, and more bugs will probably turn up. To try it,
      enable "Sandbox 1" on a Linux host.

    - Strengthen the Linux seccomp2 sandbox code: the sandbox can now
      test the arguments for rename(), and blocks _sysctl() entirely.
