  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Replace all calls to snprintf outside of src/ext with tor_snprintf.
      Fix for bug 7304.
  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Remove the #define to replace snprintf with _snprintf on windows;
      they have different semantics, and all of our callers should be
      using tor_snprintf anyway. Partial fix for bug 7304.
