  o Major features:
    - When deciding whether we have enough descriptors to build circuits,
      instead of looking at raw circuit counts, look at which fraction of
      (bandwidth-weighted) paths we're able to build. This approach keeps
      clients from building circuits if their paths are likely to stand out
      statistically. Fixes issue 5956.
