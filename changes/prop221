  o Major features:
    - Clients now look at the "usecreatefast" consensus parameter to
      decide whether to use CREATE_FAST or CREATE cells for the first hop
      of their circuit. This approach can improve security on connections
      where Tor's circuit handshake is stronger than the available TLS
      connection security levels, but the tradeoff is more computational
      load on guard relays. Implements proposal 221. Resolves ticket 9386.
