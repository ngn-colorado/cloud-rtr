  o Major features:

    - Tor now has (alpha) support for exiting to IPv6 addresses. To
      enable it as an exit node, make sure that you have IPv6
      connectivity, set the IPv6Exit flag to 1. Also make sure your
      exit policy reads as you would like: the address * applies to
      all address families, whereas *4 is IPv4 address only, and *6
      is IPv6 addresses only.  On the client side, you'll need to
      wait till the authorities have upgraded, wait for enough exits
      to support IPv6, apply the "IPv6Traffic" flag to a SocksPort,
      and use Socks5. Closes ticket 5547, implements proposal 117 as
      revised in proposal 208.

      We DO NOT recommend that clients with actual anonymity needs
      start using IPv6 over Tor yet: not enough exits support it
      yet, and there are some DNS-caching related issues that need
      to be solved first.
