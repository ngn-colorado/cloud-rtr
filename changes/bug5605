  o Minor bugfixes:
    - If changing a config option via "setconf" fails in a recoverable
      way, we used to nonetheless write our new control ports to the
      file described by the "ControlPortWriteToFile" option. Now we only
      write out that file if we successfully switch to the new config
      option. Fixes bug 5605; bugfix on 0.2.2.26-beta. Patch from "Ryman".
