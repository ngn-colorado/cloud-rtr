  o Removed config options:
    - Remove the HSAuthoritativeDir and AlternateHSAuthority torrc
      options, which were used for designating authorities as "Hidden
      service authorities". There has been no use of hidden service
      authorities since 0.2.2.1-alpha, when we stopped uploading or
      downloading v0 hidden service descriptors. Fixes bug 10881; also
      part of a fix for bug 10841.
