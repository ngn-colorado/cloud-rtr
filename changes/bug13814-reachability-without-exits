  o Minor bugfixes (Testing networks):
    - Allow Tor to build circuits using a consensus with
      no exits. If the consensus has no exits (typical of
      a bootstrapping test network), allow Tor to build
      circuits once enough descriptors have been
      downloaded.
      This assists in bootstrapping a testing Tor
      network.
      Fixes bug 13718; bugfix on 0.2.4.10-alpha. Patch by "teor".
