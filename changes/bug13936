  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Use circuit_has_opened() instead of rend_client_rendcirc_has_opened()
      when a rendezvous circuit is opened because circuit_has_opened() jobs
      is to call a specialized function depending on the circuit purpose.
      Furthermore, a controller event will be triggered here where the
      former did not.
