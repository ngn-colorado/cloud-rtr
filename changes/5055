  o Minor features (IPv6):
    - Add GeoIP database for IPv6 addresses and use it. The new config
      option is GeoIPv6File.
      Bridge clients connecting over IPv6 are now counted in bridge
      statistics. Bridge statistics files now list "bridge-ip-versions"
      and extra-info documents list "geoip6-db-digest".
      The control protocol has been extended to support more IPv6
      ("CLIENTS_SEEN" and "ip-to-country").
      Initial implementation by shkoo, addressing ticket 5055.
