8 Slot FFT Reference Design

This file contains the details of all the contents of this reference design. It also contains the steps to complete the design.

This reference designs contains the following folders:

1. library
2. projects
3. HLS_IP
4. Update_FFT
5. pr_flow

It contains the following tcl scripts:

1.build.tcl

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIBRARY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Library contains all the hardware to support HDMI output. This project requires a GPU to output an android GUI. All of this 
hardware was provided by a reference design that can located at the following linke:

Note that this reference design was slightly modified to work in 2014 version of Vivado

PROJECTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Projects contains the top level design and scripts for the HDMI design. This folder has also been taken from the HDMI reference
design mentioned above. We also modified this file slightly to accommodate partial reconfiguration. The scripts in this project
folder, with a few modifications, allows us to introduce new designs that will serve as black boxes for reconfigurable
partitions (RPs).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE_FFT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains a python file that manipulates a top level design so it reflects black boxes instead of actual FFT hardwa-
re.

DESIGN FLOW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, we have to create a static general design that will house the black boxes for partial reconfiguration. Since we are
using the HDMI reference design, this will be our starting point.

STEP 1
Run vivado and source the provided build.tcl file.

vivado
source build.tcl

STEP 2
After the base HDMI hardware has been set, we now need to add hardware blocks that will later become black boxes and then 
RPs. To do this, first we must add our FFT hardware design to the base HDMI design. 

First add the HLS_IP folder to the IP repository so we can add FFTs to the design.
tools->project settings
click on IP
click on add repository
Navigate to the location of HLS_IP (your IP)
Click select then ok

STEP 3
Now that we have added the IP to vivado, we must now add them to the design. If n slots are needed, then we add n FFTs.
